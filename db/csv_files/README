To Add New Decks to This Program:

1. Create a .csv file
  Must be in the format of a standard .csv, with 2 columns:
    header row must be: Question, Answer
    each additional row must be: Some Kind of Question, The question's answers

    example: (look at current .csv files for more examples)
    Question, Answer
    How many states in the United States?, 50
    What is the capital of California?, Sacramento

  Watch out for special characters- the SQL INSERT does not like them
  note- might be able to escape special characters...
